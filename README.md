# Mr. Peanut Butter Slack Bot
This is Mr. Peanut Butter, he is a yellow labrador, Holywoo star and a good boy.

This slack bot is a fun side project we undertook because we wanted to find creative ways to increase interaction within our class. Mr. PB matches people randomly and gives them reasons to connect. He can also do other fun stuff.


## TODO

1. The Random groups generating class doesn't look at participation status in the table right now. Add code to check table in start_group_chats()
2. Streamlining Exception handling and logging
3. Documentation - \
    a. add docstrings to all functions
    b. add installation and start-up instructions to README
